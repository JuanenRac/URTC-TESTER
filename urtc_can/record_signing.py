"""Sign the records a program writes (a saved session, an update report) with a key that stays on this computer.

The programs already name a log or an image by its SHA-256, which shows that a record and its log belong together.
That does not show who wrote the record, nor that nobody rewrote both. A signature with a key that only this user holds
adds that: whoever has the public key of the user can check that the record was written by a program running with the
user's key and was not changed afterwards.

What it proves, and what it does not:

* it proves the record and the key belong together, and that the record was not edited after it was signed;
* it does not prove who the person behind the key is: the key is made on the first use, there is no authority above it.
  A reader decides to trust a public key (by its key id) the same way he trusts an SSH key.

The key is a 32-byte seed in a text file (hexadecimal), by default ``~/.urtc-keys/records_ed25519.key``, or the file
named by ``URTC_RECORD_KEY_FILE``. It is made the first time a record is signed and is never printed or logged. The
signature is Ed25519 (RFC 8032), standard library only; the browser program makes the same signature with WebCrypto.

The signed message is ``urtc-record/1`` + a line break + the kind + a line break + the payload, where the payload of a
saved session is ``log_file``, ``log_sha256`` and ``log_bytes`` one per line, and the one of an update report is its
``report_sha256``, and the one of an evidence record (``urtc-evidence/1``) is its ``evidence_sha256``: the digest already covers every other
field, so signing the digest signs the whole record.
